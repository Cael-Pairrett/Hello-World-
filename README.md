# Hi, I’m Cael 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile.

I’m a Business Analytics & Information Systems (BAIS) student at the University of Iowa who enjoys working with data and building tools that actually solve problems. Most of my projects focus on analytics, automation, and learning new tech skills along the way.

## What I’m learning / working on

- Python scripting
- SQL and databases
- Excel dashboards and data analysis
- GitHub + version control
- AWS cloud basics

I like taking messy data and turning it into something useful or easier to understand.

---

## Tools I use a lot

- Python  
- SQL  
- Excel
- Spyder  
- GitHub  

---

## Right now

- Building Python and SQL projects for practice
- Learning how to use GitHub
- Practicing analytics and data visualization  
- Looking for internships in data analytics, business intelligence, or tech roles

## Outside of school

When I’m not on my computer, I’m usually outside:

- hunting  
- fishing  
- skiing  
- pretty much anything outdoors  

It’s a good balance from staring at a screen all day.
